# Slow-Feature-Analysis-on-RGB-Image-Data
This repository documents an implementation of Slow Feature Analysis on sample land tiles from UK's Peak District National Park, that was performed during Alan Turing Institute's Data Study Group in May 2023. The Slow Feature Analysis algorithm was developed by C. Wu et al. and here goes its citation: C. Wu, B. Du, and L. Zhang, “Slow feature analysis for change detection in multispectral imagery,” IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 52, no. 5, pp. 2858–2874, 2014.
